# mnist_digits
A CNN model trained on the MNIST handwritten digit database, which can recognize handwritten digits (with Gradio app implementation)

mnist_cnn.ipynb - a Python Jupyter notebook in which we use the PyTorch library to train a convolutive neural network (CNN) on the MNIST hand-drawn digit database (http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).

mnist_model.pth - the PyTorch model saved from the notebook run

mnist_model_weights.pth - the PyTorch model weights saved from the notebook run

app.py - a Python file which implements a Gradio sketchpad app to let us experiment with this trained model

This app is implemented and hosted here: https://huggingface.co/spaces/etweedy/digits
